# Bupie
Simple shell script that I wrote for the first time. Does nothing but a "bup" sound, or alternatively, a bell sound.
> P.S. Only was tested on MacOS! I don't know how it will work on Linux, but you can test it and say if it works.

# Instructions
1. Run `BupieInstallerMacOS` by doing `bash BupieInstallerMacOS`.
2. Then run Bupie to confrim that it works. :D
